# Henesis

Have you ever faced any problems which are listed below while developing DApps\(Decentralized Applications\)?‌

* I'm not sure that I have subscribed all data from blockchain without loss. 
* It's difficult to check whether transactions are mined or not.
* It's hard to sync with blockchain because of frequent disconnections from the node.

Henesis provides following features to address above mentioned problems.‌

* Listen, filter, parse and deliver blockchain data without loss in real-time
* Reorganization Tolerance.
* Fully-managed stable blockchain node.

Without Henesis, you have to‌

* Manage a stable blockchain node by yourself.
* Write your own code for subscribing to blockchain events.
* Manually deal with a chain reorganization.
* Inspect a transaction pool or a latest block for tracking transactions.

Sounds terrible, doesn't it?‌

From now on, Henesis will take care of everything instead of you.
