# Introduction

When creating a blockchain service, you need to subscribe to all the information from the Non-Fungible Token\(NFT\) and quickly convey this information to your users. For example, when a customer requests to receive their NFT information in one place, you must collect and retrieve all the NFT information and deliver it to the user-interface. If any of the information is missing or delivered too slowly, that can put your service and user-base in jeopardy. 

The NFT API was developed to address this problem. The Henesis NFT API provides an easy-to-use endpoint for blockchain game developers, and provides quick access to information about NFTs that conform to the ERC721 standard. The NFT API provides significant information on the ERC721 as ‘token’, a data type.
